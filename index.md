## About me
Hi, Im a 16 year old kid (soon to be adult) and this is one of my first ever projects! I'm a very big sports fan such as F1 (Mercedes being my favourite team), football and cricket. My favourite color is Tiffany Blue (a really cool blend of blue and green) and my favourite dish is fried rice. I hope to learn a lot about coding through my grade 11 year and carry it into my future as well! :D
